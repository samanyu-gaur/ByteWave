    title: "Watch: Double Pendulum — Why does it go chaotic?",
    body: `This Manim animation shows a double pendulum in motion. Even though both rods follow the same Newtonian mechanics, the system becomes completely unpredictable after just a few seconds.

Why does this happen? A single pendulum is periodic — it swings on a regular cycle. But in a double pendulum, tiny differences in starting angle amplify exponentially. This is deterministic chaos: the equations are exact, but the motion is practically impossible to predict.

Key physics concepts shown:
• Conservation of energy — total mechanical energy stays constant, transferring between rotational KE, linear KE, and PE
• Newton's second law for rotational motion: torque = Iα
• Coupled differential equations — two pendulums linked by a shared pivot
• Sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect)

Watch the video: at what point does the motion "break" from looking predictable?`,
